    <p> Hello my name is Tywanda Shanta Harmon. I have always been one to grab fastfood quick without giving cooking a first thought. I'm at point in my life that i feel is important to prepare my own meals more frequently than just grabbing fastfoods or snacking. My days go by very quick, involving work and school, therefore fastfoods always seem convenient. I know now that i have to take time out of my busy schedule to meal prep at least a few days of the week. I'm focusing more on being healthy and happy. Some foods I eat make me feel miserable afterwards. I hate feeling tired and exhausted, meanwhile I know I'm taking a step in the right direction by creating my quick recipes.      
    <p>On the otherhand, I have decided to make a website with some of my quick recipe solutions. This will help motivate me with meal preping and makes it fun and creative. I will continue to update my site as i come up with more creative recipe ideas. </p>
